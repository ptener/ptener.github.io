          <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/HTAPCBuildShowcase.gif" alt="" /></span>At my most recent
            research opportunity, our team worked with HTA to create VR lessons on how to
            assemble a computer. As the lead developer, I was tasked with creating the interactions between the
            different PC parts. I created a system that allowed for multiple PC parts to be encased in each other
            while adding the ability to include/exclude certain parts if desired. The research focused on
            recreating a preexisting lesson that HTA had a web based alternative to, and compare the experiences
            of people who participated in either the VR or web based experience. While our research only required
            a small amount of PC parts, our team had a simulation that included most major parts on high end
            gaming computers. In the hopes we would received more funding to continue the project, I built our
            system to be modular so that it could be easily expanded on in the future. It was the first time I had led
            such a large team for more that just a game jam, and I am very proud with what our team was able to put
            together in our time working together. If you are interested in more details about the project, you can

          <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/character_customize.gif" alt=""></span>The Indy VR Study was my
            first
            foray into real Virtual Reality. I had the chance to develop a small app for
            the Merge VR Cube for my first game jam, but the limitations that 3 degrees of freedom movement provides
            didn't wow me much. It wasn't until a few years later, when I was approached by an IUPUI faculty member
            about a Unity developer position for VR research that I saw the potential for the technology. Indy VR
            Study, or PerspectiVR as the team named it at one point, was a joint collaboration between the IU school of
            medicine, and the school of informatics and computing. The study aimed to recreate a scenario in VR
            that a psychologist would normally walk through their patient within their head. I was brought on as a
            second developer to help the lead keep up with the high workload. It was a great learning opportunity, and
            I was even able to create the character customizer that we used in the app. Aside from that, I created an
            android sister application that acted as a guide to the VR experience and contained a server for
            participants to fill out. The lead developer and I had to synch the two apps together through a Firebase
            server. I learned
            a lot of lessons about running large scale projects from this research, but most important of all, it
            ignited a passion for virtual reality that I hope to continue to grow. If you are interested in more info

            article written on the study.
