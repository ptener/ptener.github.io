										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/HungarySmile.JPG" alt="" /></span>Ever since I was a kid, my family knew me as the IT guy who would fix whatever electronics related problems we had, or at least try to.  I grew up the middle child of our family, so I grew into the role of mediator between siblings.  I have always had a fascination with technology and what it could do for my life.  The first program I wrote was a unit converter on my TI-Nspire CAS calculator because I was tired of putting in the same inputs over and over again.  Not long after I used the same TI-Nspire to make a text adventure game.  Since then I have put in considerably more time honing my game development skills.  I have been developing games in unity for the past four years mostly as a part of the Game Developers Group (GDG) at IUPUI. I spent three years in leadership for GDG with my second to last year as the vice president and the last year as the president. GDG is an academic club that tries to get students to create games, learn about them, and meet with others who are interested in game development. During my time there I have worked on around fifteen-twenty games and published my favorite 7 of them on my <a href="https://p10er101.itch.io/">itch.io</a> page.</p>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/2020HorizonLeague.jpg" alt="" /></span>Being the athlete that I am, I love to spend time outdoors being as active as possible.  I was an All American Division I diver for IUPUI and loved every moment of it.  My favorite dive being inward 2 and a half tucked (405C) on 1 meter, and my favorite category being whatever I was hitting that week.  The hardest dive I ever competed was an inward 3 and a half (407C) tucked on 3 meter, but It was only once and for 3.5 and 4.  Even though diving is very much an individual sport, my favorite memories from my time with the sport have to be from spending time with my teammates or getting to know our competitors.  Divers are some of the craziest and nicest people that I have had the chance to get to know, and with Pixel Diving I hope to give back to a community that I have gotten so much from.</p>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/FireFlipCroped.gif" alt="" /></span>Outside of diving, I have also played almost any sport that you can imagine.  In high school I participated in gymnastics and soccer along with diving, while before that I dabbled in basketball, baseball, tennis, track and field, volleyball and football.  Seeing that I spend lots of time sitting in front of my computer, I like to spend my off time doing exciting physical activities like rock climbing or cliff diving when available.  I also have picked up some more obscure hobbies like juggling, yo-yoing, and playing piano.  Learning is one of my favorite things to do, so I often find myself trying new things whenever I get the chance.</p>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/SanFranCurtis.JPG" alt="" /></span>One of my larger hobbies is of course gaming.  I have been playing games ever since I got a hand me down Game Boy with a copy of Pokemon Red version as a kid.  I grew up as a fan of Pokemon, Zelda, Mega Man, Sonic, Sid Meier's Civilization, and Lego Star Wars games.  Minecraft with its mods and servers was the first game that introduced me to the magic of computers and programming; Portal 1 and 2 were some of the first PC games I played that changed how I viewed FPS games.  Rainbow 6 Siege was my first foray into competitive gaming, while games like Beatsaber and Superhot VR have recently changed my mind on the future of gaming.  Games such as Undertale or Celeste have shown me the beauty and innovation that Indie studios can produce.  Trying to narrow down a list of my favorite games would be impossible, so just know that there are a lot and the list continues to grow.</p>
